## Size & Orientation

iPhone sizes are measured interms of points and pixels. For example iPhone 2G and 3G has 320 x 480 points and 
rendered at 1x -> 320x480 pixels. This means 1 point can accomodate one pixel.

Likewise iPhone 4 and 4s has 320 x 480 points and rendered at 2x -> 640 x 960 pixels. This means each point 
can accomodate 2 pixels
